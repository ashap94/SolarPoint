            <ul>
              <li>
                The origin of the word “Earth” is the eighth-century Anglo-Saxon
                word “erda” the meaning of which is “soil” or “ground”.
              </li>
              <li>Earth is the 3rd number planet rotates around the sun.</li>
              <li>
                It takes 8.3 minutes for light to travel from the Sun to the
                Earth.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System. The reason
                for this high density is the apparent collision, over four
                billion years ago, of a proto-Earth and a hypothetical
                Mars-sized planet Theia.
              </li>
              <li>
                The gravity between the Earth and the Moon causes the tides on
                Earth.
              </li>
              <li>
                The rotation of the Earth is gradually slowing down. The
                deceleration of the Earth’s rotation is very slow, approximately
                17 milliseconds per hundred years. Eventually this will lengthen
                our days but it will take around 140 million years before our
                day will have increased from 24 to 25 hours.

                The highest point found on Earth is Mount Everest which reaches
                a height of 8.8 km.
              </li>
              <li>
                The lowest point on Earth is called Challenger Deep and at 10.9
                km below sea level, it is further than the peak of Mount
                Everest.
              </li>
              <li>
                Earth’s atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and
                trace amounts of other gases including argon and carbon dixoide.
              </li>
              <li>
                Earth is the only special planet of the Solar system that
                contains life due to the presence of liquid water in abundance
                and free atmospheric oxygen.

              <li>
                Hawaii is moving towards Japan at the speed of 10cm a year. This
                is because they are on different tectonic plates.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Earth isn't perfectly round, it is slightly flattened at the
                north and south poles.
              </li>
              <li>
                Earth has a very powerful magnetic field. This field protects
                the planet from the effects of solar winds and is believed to be
                a result of the nickel-iron core of the planet combined with its
                rapid rotation.
              </li>

              <li>
                Scientists have the dated the Earth as being between 4 and 5
                billion years old
              </li>
              <li>
                The earliest accepted evidence of life on the Earth dates back
                approximately 3.5 billion years ago.

              <li>
                Between 3.2 and 2.4 billion years ago, the photosynthetic
                organisms appeared that started the atmosphere to be enriched
                with oxygen.

          <p>
            Leo, your sign is governed by the sun. The sun is the center of our
            solar system, which is the reason you enjoy being the center of
            attention so much. Bright and vibrant, it brings warmth to everyone,
            much like you. But the sun is also hot and can burn you if you get
            too close. The same can be said for you. When you get irritated,
            your temper tends to flare out of control.

                The Sun makes up around 99.86% of the Solar System’s mass. A
                mass 330,000 times that of Earth
              </li>
              <li>If the Sun was hollow, 960,000 Earth's would fit inside</li>
              <li>
                One day the Sun will consume the Earth. The Sun will continue to
                burn for about 130 million years after it burns through all of
                its hydrogen, instead burning helium. During this time it will
                expand to such a size that it will engulf Mercury, Venus, and
                Earth. When it reaches this point, it will have become a red
                giant star.
              </li>
              <li>
                The energy created by the Sun’s core is nuclear fusion. This
                huge amount of energy is produced when four hydrogen nuclei are
                combined into one helium nucleus.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Sun is almost a perfect sphere. Considering the sheer size
                of the Sun, there is only a 10 km difference in its polar and
                equatorial diameters – this makes it the closest thing to a
                perfect sphere observed in nature.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Sun will eventually be about the size of Earth. Once the Sun
                has completed its red giant phase, it will collapse. It’s huge
                mass will be retained, but it will have a volume similar to that
                of Earth. When that happens, it will be known as a white dwarf.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Sun is halfway through its life. At 4.5 billion years old,
                the Sun has burned off around half of its hydrogen stores and
                has enough left to continue burning hydrogen for another 5
                billion years. Currently the Sun is a yellow dwarf star.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Sun is travelling at 220 km per second. It is around
                24,000-26,000 light-years from the galactic centre and it takes
                the Sun approximately 225-250 million years to complete one
                orbit of the centre of the Milky Way.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Sun’s core is around 13600000 degrees Celsius!
              </li>
              <li>
                Around 74% of the Sun’s mass is made up of hydrogen. Helium
                makes up around 24% while heavier elements such as oxygen,
                carbon, iron and neon make up the remaining percentage.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Sun produces a solar wind which contains charged particles
                such as electrons and protons. They escape the Sun’s intense
                gravity because of their high kinetic energy and the high
                temperature of the Sun’s corona (a type of plasma atmosphere
                that extends into space).
              </li>
              <li>
                Planets with strong magnetic fields such as Earth manage to
                deflect most of these charged particles as they approach.
              </li>
              <li>
                These winds while beautiful, can cause problems here on Earth.
                They can interfere with satellites. Our cell phones might not
                work. Our televisions might not work.
              </li>
              <li>
                A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon is between the Sun and the
                Earth.

              </li>
              <li>
                The planet is named after the Roman god Mercury. Mercury was the
                messenger to the gods and the god of travelers and merchants.
              </li>
              <li>
                Mercury orbits so quickly around the Sun that early
                civilizations believed it was actually two different stars – one
                which appeared in the morning and another which appeared in the
                evening.
              </li>
              <li>Mercury is the second densest planet in the solar system.</li>
              <li>
                The iron core in Mercury is very large compared to other rocky
                planets like Earth and Mars. This makes Mercury's mass very high
                compared to its size.
              </li>
              <li>
                The planet has just 38% of the gravity on Earth. This means that
                Mercury isn’t able to hold the atmosphere it has and it instead
                gets blown away by solar winds.
              </li>
              <li>
                The surface of Mercury is very similar to our moon. It has a
                very barren, rocky surface covered with many craters.
              </li>
              <li>
                Being so close to the Sun, the daytime temperature on Mercury is
                scorching - reaching over 400 Degrees Celsius.
              </li>
              <li>
                At night however, without an atmosphere to hold the heat in, the
                temperatures plummet, dropping to -180 Degrees Celsius.
              </li>
              <li>
                Only two spacecraft have ever visited Mercury. The Sun’s gravity
                makes it difficult for satellites to orbit Mercury.
              </li>

                The Mariner 10 visited during 1974-75, flying by Mercury three
                times and mapping half its surface. On March 24, 1975 it ran out
                of fuel and is still believed to be orbiting the Sun.

            Venus is the planet of love, which is why you always develop a
            strong relationship to those around you. You aren't one who craves
            alone time, and you have Venus to thank. But it's also the reason
            you are the best at maintaining stable relationships. You know what
            you have to do to make them work, all thanks to Venus.

                Venus is the second planet from the Sun and the third brightest
                object in Earth's sky after the Sun and Moon.
              </li>
              <li>
                Venus is sometimes referred to as the sister planet to Earth,
                because their size and mass are so similar. Venus is also the
                closest planet to Earth.
              </li>
              <li>
                Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system with an average
                surface temperature of 462°C (863°F).
              </li>
              <li>
                It takes 6.0 minutes for light to travel from the Sun to Venus
              </li>
              <li>
                Billions of years ago, the climate of Venus may been similar to
                that of Earth and scientists believe that Venus once possessed
                large amounts of water or oceans. However, due to the high
                temperatures produce from the extreme greenhouse effect, this
                water boiled off long ago and the surface of the planet is now
                too hot and hostile to sustain life.
              </li>
              <li>
                The temperature on Venus doesn’t vary much between the night and
                day. This is due to the slow movement of the solar winds across
                the surface of the planet.
              </li>
              <li>
                The atmospheric pressure of Venus is 92 times stronger than
                Earth’s. This means that any small asteroids entering the
                atmosphere of Venus are crushed by the immense pressure, which
                is why there are no small surface craters on the planet. This
                pressure is equivalent to being around 1,000 km under Earth’s
                oceans.
              </li>
              <li>
                Venus is the only planet in the Solar System to be named after a
                female figure.
              </li>
              <li>
                Venus orbits the sun in an ellipse, but its orbit is the closest
                to being a circle out of all the planets in the Solar System.
              </li>
              <li>
                Venus is the closest planet to Earth. When Venus is in line with
                Earth and the Sun, it is the closest planet to us, at an average
                distance of 41 million kilometers (25.5 million miles) away.
              </li>
              <li>
                Venus has a very weak magnetic field. This surprised scientists,
                who expected Venus to have a magnetic field similar in strength
                to Earth’s. One possible reason for this is that Venus has no
                solid inner core, or that its core is not cooling.

          <p>
            Tough on the outside, but soft on the inside, you're a deeply
            sensitive individual. You are ruled by your emotions, which is
            caused by the moon being your ruling planet. The moon is closely
            associated with human emotion, so it influences you to put the needs
            of others before your own. When others ask why you're so sensitive,
            feel free to blame the moon.

                The Moon is the Earth’s only natural satellite. A natural
                satellite is a space body that orbits a planet, a planet like
                object or an asteroid.
              </li>
              <li>
                It takes 1.3 seconds for light to travel from the Moon to Earth.
              </li>
              <li>It is the fifth largest moon in the Solar System.</li>
              <li>The Moon orbits the Earth every 27.3 days.</li>
              <li>
                Mons Huygens is the tallest mountain on the Moon, it is 4700
                metres tall, just over half the height of Mt Everest (8848m).
              </li>
              <li>
                The Moon rotates on its axis in around the same length of time
                it takes to orbit the Earth. This means that from Earth we only
                ever see around 60% of its surface (50% at any one time).
              </li>
              <li>
                The effect of gravity is only about one fifth (17%) as strong on
                the surface of the Moon compared to the strength of gravity on
                the surface of the Earth.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Earth’s tides are largely caused by the gravitational pull

                The Soviet Union’s Luna program featured the first successful

                The far side of the Moon looks quite different due to its lack

                The Moon is very hot during the day but very cold at night. The

                The planet is named after Mars, the Roman god of war. It was
                known to the ancient Greeks as Ares, their god of war. This is
                thought to be because of the blood-red color of the planet which
                was also used by other ancient cultures.

              <li>
                It takes 12.6 minutes for light to travel from the Sun to Mars
              </li>
              <li>
                Mars has many massive volcanoes and is home to Olympus Mons, the
                largest volcano in our solar system, it stands 21km high and is
                600km across the base.
              </li>
              <li>
                The polar ice caps consist of frozen Co2 (dry ice) which lies
                over a layer of ice.
              </li>
              <li>
                The landmass of Mars and Earth is very similar. Despite Mars
                being just 15% the volume and 10% the mass of Earth, it actually
                has a similar landmass because water covers about 70% of Earth’s
                surface. The surface gravity of Mars is about 37% the gravity
                found on Earth. This means that on Mars you could in theory jump
                3x higher than you could on Earth.
              </li>
              <li>
                Only 16 of the 39 Mars missions have been successful. Beginning
                with the USSR’s Marsnik 1 which was launched in 1960, 39
                orbiters, landers and rovers have been to Mars but only 16 of
                those missions were a success.
              </li>
              <li>
                In 2016, Europe’s Exobiology on Mars program will search the
                planet for signs of Martian life as well as study the surface
                and terrain of the planet and map potential environmental
                hazards to future manned missions to Mars.
              </li>
              <li>
                With the exception of Earth, Mars is the most hospitable to life
                – a number of space missions are planning for the next decade
                the further increase our understanding of Mars and when it has
                the potential for extraterrestrial life, as well as whether it
                may be a viable planet for a colony.
              </li>
              <li>It takes Mars 687 Earth days to orbit the Sun.</li>
              <li>
                Mars is the only other planet besides Earth that has polar ice
                caps. The northern cap is called the Planum Boreum, with Planum
                Australe in the south. Water ice has also been found under the
                Martian ice caps.
              </li>
              <li>
                Mars has seasons like Earth, but they last twice as long. This
                is because Mars is tilted on its axis by about 25.19 degrees,
                which is similar to the axial tilt of the Earth (22.5 degrees).

              <li>Jupiter’s Great Red Spot is an enormous storm that has been raging for over 300 years. This storm is so wide that three
              Earth’s would fit inside of it.</li>
              <li>
                It takes 43.2 minutes for light to travel from the Sun to
                Jupiter
              </li>
              <li>The first recorded sighting of Jupiter were by the ancient Babylonians in around 7th or 8th BC. It is named for Jupiter,
              the king of the Roman gods and god of the Sky. The Greek equivalent is Zeus, god of thunder. For the Mesopotamians, he
              was the god Marduk and patron of the city of Babylon. Germanic tribes saw the planet as Donar, also known as Thor.</li>
              <li>Thick, colorful clouds of deadly poisonous gases surround Jupiter. The quick spinning of the planet whips up the
              atmosphere, creating the bands around the planet.</li>
              <li>Jupiter has the shortest day of the eight planets. The planet rotates very Jupiter rotates very quickly, turning on its
              axis once every 9 hours and 55 minutes. This rapid rotation is also what causes the flattening effect of the planet,
              which is why it has an oblate shape.</li>
              <li>At the centre of Jupiter is a rocky core, slightly bigger than Earth but weighing about 20 times more.</li>
              <li>Surrounding the core is an ocean of liquid hydrogen, about 1,000 kilometres deep.</li>
              <li>Jupiter has many storms raging on the surface, most notably the big red spot which is the largest hurricane in our Solar
              System. It's been raging for over three hundred years.</li>
              <li>Jupiter has a very strong magnetic field, you would weigh two and a half times as much as you would on Earth.</li>
              <li>Jupiter has many moons circling around it. Four of these moons are bigger than Pluto.</li>
